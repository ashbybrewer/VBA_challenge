# VBA_challenge
For this challenge I primarily used sources from the class as well as doing study groups with other students last Tuesday and Thursday. Off the top of my head I worked with Margo, Dale, Maria, and I think a Joshua. 

Outside of working with other students, my tutor, and referencing classwork, I also referenced:

I also found a public github file for a very similar assignment that had source code in it as well, I used that to reference against mine: https://github.com/DataTell/VBA-Challenge
